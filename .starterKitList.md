# Package Management

![package managers](https://scontent-syd2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27657887_10159890686275117_1580123957011304836_n.jpg?oh=f3ede23fd5b7a8b9899de0d29c466a93&oe=5B0C5F1C)

These days we have a variety of Javascript managers to choose from. Although npm is usually the favourite. Bower used to be a popular option but npm has become the most used javascript package manager. Yarn is also another big player these days, usually much faster than npm.

### Package Security

Packages can be published to npm by anyone, so if this makes you a bit paranoid here's some security scanning you can implement.

* [retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/)
* [Node Security Platform](https://nodesecurity.io/)

These are 2 ways you can check a projects dependencies for known vulnerabilities. 

# Dev server

Here is a list of Development webservers. Note, with the exception of EXPRESS, these webservers are not for production, they're merely for hosting your app for development in your local machine.

Express (full featured, highly configurable, production grade)
Koa
Hapi
http-server(npm package)
live-server(lightweight, supports live-reloading)
Webpack(has its own dev server, hot reloading)
Browsersync(automatically sets up a dedicated IP address for local network, use the same IP in diff devices and all devices will remain in sync! and it can be used along with bundlers like webpack, Browserify, Gulp and more )

### configure EXPRESS

* add a folder to your build called `srcServer`

* add this code

```js
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var open = require('open');

var port = 3000;
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../src/index.html'));
});

app.listen(port, function(err){
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    open('http://localhost:' + port);
  }
})
```
* build said src folder witth an index.html file inside.

* in the command line run

    $ node buildScripts/srcServer.js

HOW AWESOME NPM SCRIPTS ARE
YOU CAN AUTOMATE COMMANDS TO RUN TWO SERVERS AT ONCE, INCLUDING AN ONLINE SERVER TO SHARE WORK UPDATES
LEARN NODE/NPM SCRIPTS

# TESTING AND CI

### UNIT TESTING

* Unit testing focuses on testing a single function or module in an automated fashion.
* Unit tests often assert that a certain function returns an expected value when passed certain parameters
* Unit tests mock out external dependencies like API's, database calls and file system interactions, so the results are fast and deterministic

TWO OTHER STYLES TO LOOK INTO ARE
INTERGRATION TESTING-WHICH FOCUSES ON TESTING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MULTIPLE MODULES
AUTOMATED UI TESTING-WHICH TESTS THE APPLICATION BY AUTOMATING CLICKS AND KEYSTROKES WITHIN THE ACTUAL UI AND ASSERTING THAT IT INTERACTS IN EXPECTED WAYS...

### Unit testing decisions

1. Frameworks
2. Assertion Library
3. Helper Libraries
4. Where to run tests
5. Where to place tests
6. Where to run tests

1. Testing Framework

![]()

Mocha- is the most popular, highly configurable, large support ecosystem.
Jasmine- nearly as popular as mocha and quite similar, but jasmine includes an assertion library built in
Tape- leanest and simplest of the bunch, simplicity and minimal configuration are its key strengths
QUnit- oldest on this list, created for testing jquery by jquery's creator john resik
AVA- runs your tests in parallel and it only re-runs impacted tests, both of which help speed results
Jest- from facebook and popular for react developers, it has code coverage, js DOM and popular convensions for finding your test files all built in

2. Assertion libraries

Many test frameworks like jasmine and Jest come with an assertion library built in, but some like Mocha, dont come with an assertion library so we have to pick our own.

An assertion is a way to declare what you expect

The most popular assertion library is chai, the differences between them are generally minor syntactic differences, so dont spend too much time worrying about these.

3. Helper Libraries

Should we use a helper library? and if so which one?

JSDOM- is an implementation in the browsers DOM which you can run in JS, so we can run tests that rely on the DOM without opening an actual browser. this keeps your testing configuration for automated tests simpler and often means the tests run faster because they're not reliant on running in the browser.
Cheerio- you can think of cheerio as jquery for the server, this is really handy if you're using JSDOM, cause you can write tests that assert that certain HTML is where you expect it. And if you know how to use jquery you already know how to work with cheerio, because it uses Jquery selectors for quering the DOM

4. where to run tests

There are three popular option as to where to run our tests

The most obvious option is running our tests in the `browser`, Karma and Testem are popular options for running tests in the browser, however. opening an actual browser requires more configuration and its much slower to the alternative

Another option is to run a `Headless Browser` like PhantomJS. A headless browser is a browser that doesnt have a 
visible user interface. PhantomJS is a full real browser running the v8 engine behing the scenes, but you cant see phantomJS because it has no visible interface. this is usefull because otfen writing automated tests, you dont need to see the
actual interface, you just need something fast that simulates a real browser.

The third option is to use an `In-memory DOM` such as JSDOM, it is a library that simulates an actual browser by creating a DOM in memory that we can interact with, JSDOM is like a lightweight alternative to PhantomJS, because JSDOM doesnt have a full browser behind the scenes, the advantage of this approach is that its fast and quick to set up.

5. Where do test files belong?

Cantralized vs Alonside

naming files with .test & .spec are very popular

TODO!!!!!!!!!!!!

6. When should tests run

Unit tests should run everytime you hit save

unit vs intergration tests
TODO!!!!!!!!!!
